# YouTube-Channel-Seeker
YouTube Channel Seeker is a mini-proyect developed in Python, which implements a graphical interface (GUI) using PyQt5 library and a YouTube API connection. It's a tool that can create, read, update and delete (CRUD) a number of channels with some information such as name, link (URL) and category, which you can get from channels you're subscribe to.
