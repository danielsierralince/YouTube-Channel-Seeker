# YouTube-Channel-Seeker
YouTube Channel Seeker is a mini-proyect developed in Python, which implements a graphical interface (GUI) using PyQt5 library and a YouTubev3 API connection to Google Cloud. It's a tool that can create, read, update and delete (CRUD) a number of channels with some information such as name, link (URL) and category, which you can get from channels you're subscribe to. In addition, it implements other types of basic functionalities, such as validations, filters and exceptions, to give the user a better experience.

## Requirements

You can run the following command in the console, after being located in the folder that contains the "requirements.txt" file.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The "requirements.txt" file contains a list of the packages required for the project and their versions. Make sure you have an up-to-date version of the "requirements.txt" file to avoid potential errors.

## API Access

To fully test the functionality of the project, a secret key in ".json" format is required to access the request made on the web to connect to the API. If your account is not set as Tester of the app, try creating your Google Cloud account and downloading your own secret key to attach to the project to successfully get YouTube channel subscriptions.
